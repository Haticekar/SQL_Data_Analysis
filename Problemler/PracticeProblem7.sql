/*
Find the count of the number of remote job postings per skill
    - Display the top 5 skills by their demand in remote jobs
    - Include skill ID, name and count of postings requiring the skill.
*/

/*
ðŸ’¡**Solution:**

- `remote_job_skills` CTE counts how many times each skill is associated with a remote job posting from the `job_postings` table
- The main query joins CTE with the `skills` table to get the actual skill names associated with each `skill_id`
- The result is ordered by the `skill_count` from the largest amount of skills to the least
- Use `LIMIT`; we only get the top 5 skills
