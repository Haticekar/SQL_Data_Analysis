QUESTION:
**What are the most optimal skills to learn (aka it‚Äôs in high demand and a high-paying skill) for a data analyst?** 

- Identify skills in high demand and associated with high average salaries for Data Analyst roles
- Concentrates on remote positions with specified salaries
- Why? Targets skills that offer job security (high demand) and financial benefits (high salaries), offering strategic insights for career development in data analysis

**üñ•Ô∏è Query:**

- CTE `skills_demand` - identifies skills in demand for Data Analyst roles (aggregates count by skill):
    - This is similar to Query #3.
    - In the `SELECT` statement it gets:
        - `skill_id` for the id of the skill
        - `skills` for skill name
        - Counts job (`job_id`) using `COUNT`.
    - Uses `FROM` and `INNER JOIN` to match `job_postings_fact` with `skills_dim` through `skills_job_dim`, to link job postings with the required skills.
        - `FROM`: First get the data from the `job_postings_fact` table.
        - First `INNER JOIN`: (`job_postings_fact` and `skills_job_dim`) - link each job IDs with its corresponding skill ID from the `skills_job_dim` table.
        - Second `INNER JOIN`: (result of the first join and `skills_dim`) - result from the first join (which now includes job IDs and skill IDs from `skills_job_dim`) is then joined with the `skills_dim` table using the `skill_id` field to get the skill name
    -
- Filters in the `WHERE` clause:
    - 'Data Analyst' positions
    - with specified salaries,
    - that are remote
- Groups by skill ID (`GROUP BY`).
- CTE `average_salary` - calculates the average salary per skill for Data Analyst roles (aggregates average salary by skill):
    - This is similar to Query #4.
    - In `SELECT` statement it:
        - Gets `skill_id`
        - Average salary (`salary_year_avg`) using `AVG`.
    - Uses `FROM` and `INNER JOIN` to link job postings to skills.
        - `FROM:` We‚Äôll be first grabbing data from the `job_postings_fact` table.
        - `INNER JOIN`: (`job_postings_fact` and `skills_job_dim`) - link each job IDs with its corresponding skill ID from the `skills_job_dim` table.
    - Filters in the `WHERE` clause:
        - 'Data Analyst' positions
        - with specified salaries,
        - that are remote.
    - Groups by skill ID (`GROUP BY`).
